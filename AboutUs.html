					<h4> Importance of awareness </h4>
					<p>	It is important for people to know what exactly Autism is in order to create a more encluding environment for people with Autism,
						as it is not really a disability, people with Autism just have different social and intellectual abilities. It is thus important to
						inform people on this matter and methods to make communication and cooperation, with people who have Autism, easier.
